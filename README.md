# And what is this?

Just a simple code-notebook to write learnings and observations about how to use React and Redux in a project. 
Good practices or things I liked from my own experience or trustable sources. 

At this point it is just intended for reading. Do not try to build or run. 

EVENTUALLY THIS WILL BECOME A NEW REPOSITORY ORGANIZED AS DOCUMENTATION-BOOK.
